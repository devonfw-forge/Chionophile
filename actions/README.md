# Generic benchmark

This a basic program that uses a configuration file in YAML to create load benchmarks using the Goose Framework.

## Objective

Give the option to make load benchmarks in an efficient language like Rust without the need to know how to write it yourself.

## Usage

The configuration options are the following:

- host
- port
- use_https
- base_path
- users
- goose_log
- user_creation_rate
- run_time
- report_file
- request_log
- request_body
- error_log
- debug_log
- max_request_second
- no_reset_metric

All of them are explained in [this page of the Goose documentation](https://docs.rs/goose/latest/goose/config/struct.GooseConfiguration.html). 
The only changes are **user_creation_rate** and **max_request_second** that correspond with **hatch_rate** and **throttle_requests** respectively.

Under the **benchmarks** section you can define a series of request-groups that will fall under that benchmark name. Define as many benchmarks as 
you want with as many request-groups and individual requests as necessary.

Take into account that all of the requests in a request-group will be executed consecutively. That means that if an individual request fails, the rest of the group will not be executed.

The next options are designed to configure a DELETE request after a POST request:
- should_delete
- body_field_for_delete
- delete_end_slash

If should_delete is true, the program will look for the indicated field in body_field_for_delete in the POST request's response. The delete_end_slash tells the program 
if a "/" should be added at the end of the URL. 

For example:
1. A POST request is made with the next URL **/visitormanagement/v1/visitor/**
2. It returns the following response:
``
  {
    "id"Â¨: 123
    "username": "user@mail.com",
    "name": "pepe",
    "phoneNumber": "+34623456789",
    "password": "paco",
    "acceptedTerms": true,
    "acceptedCommercial": false
  }
  
``
 3. should_delete is true
 4. body_field_for_delete is "id"
 5. The program looks for the "id" field in the previous response
 6. If delete_end_slash is true, it makes a DELETE request with this URL: **/visitormanagement/v1/visitor/123/**
 7. If delete_end_slash is false, it makes a DELETE request with this URL: **/visitormanagement/v1/visitor/123**
